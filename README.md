A term project for 15-112 at CMU. 
I have played this board game since I was six years old.
I am actually very good at this game, but I have never thought of making a computer player for the game.
Thank Mr Davis, my instructor for 15-112 at CMU, for giving me new inspiration in Python.
Thank Alan, my term project mentor, even he did not really help me with the code.
Thank my best friend Bradley for having been beaten by my computer so many times and still helped me with testing.
